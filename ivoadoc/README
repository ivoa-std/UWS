This directory contains files to help with the authorship of IVOA documents, which must be primarily be delivered as HTML.
The scripts allow for features not normally associated with HTML authoring

1. automated section numbering and table of contents generation
2. automated reference handling with bibtex.
3. formatting of included xml files.

Aims
----

1. Author the document in XHTML - allows both text and popular WYSIWYG editors to be used.
2. Allow the document created by one iteration of the processing to be used as input for the next stage - this allows tweaks to be made in a WYSIWIG editor to the final output format
that will be then auto-numbered for instance.


Authoring
---------

initailly can just do <cite>bibref</cite> 
    <span class="xref">UWSSchema</span>
    
    note that <a> anchors need both an id attribute and a name attribute - it is the id attribute that the xslt keys off.



Requirements
------------

Ant build file - this requires that the saxon xslt processor is available to ant - an easy way to do this is to place the saxon jar 
in ~/.ant/lib/

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project name="UWSbuild">

Acknowledgements
---------------

The scripts and ideas for this are derived from originals by Norman Gray, and efforts have been made to preserve his conventions. The major 
difference being that the formatting script may be used iteratively, rather than the final output being a 'one-shot' batch processed result of the input, that cannot again be used as input.
